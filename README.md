# Area Man

A small fun project to apply some ubiquitous packages. Area Man will accept a birthday and return the results of whatever "area man" nonsense coincides with it. There is no data-harvesting with this.

## Notes

* Running NextJS 13, which features updated [app routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts). The folder structure in this project is to use (ie) app/about/page.tsx, which resolves to /about.
* Imported the [clsx library](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) since it's teeny, even though it's a fun code exercise to spin your own utility class.

## Requirements

* Minimum Node v16.8
* Search app API key
